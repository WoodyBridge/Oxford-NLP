MSc Social Data Science @ Oxford Uni 2018/2019 - Module NLP

This project is my summative for the course Natural Language Processing.

"An Explanatory Analysis of Airbnb Property Names and their Relationship to Price" is the title of the research paper this code was created for. 

Findings from this paper show the most populous unigrams/bigrams/trigrams associated with high and low listing prices of Airbnbs in London.

2 types of predictive models are also created to predict Airbnb listing demand from the listing description.
